We have 2 approaches to solve the problem: Naive Approach & Efficient Approach

1. Naive Approach

The basic approach is to find the maximum of both numbers, then iterate from that number, till we find a number that is completely divisible by both numbers.

Time Complexity: O(a*b - max(a,b))



2. Efficient Approach

An efficient solution is based on the below formula for LCM of two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’. 

a x b = LCM(a, b) * GCD (a, b)

LCM(a, b) = (a x b) / GCD(a, b)

Here, we calculate GCD using, Optimised Euclidean Algorithm.

Then, further, calculate LCM.

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a,b))
